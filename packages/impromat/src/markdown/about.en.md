Impromat is an application for improvisers to plan their
improvisational theatre workshops. It lists publicly available improv exercises and games from various categories to support with the creation of new workshops.

# About the Author

I am Marco, passionate improviser and coder. When I got more and more into holding improv workshops I found myself thinking about new workshop inputs over and over again. I did not find a good improv tool to manage workshops and get inspirations from improv exercises and games that I knew already.

Thus, my first step was building a web scraper to download publicly available improv elements from websites like Improwiki. I used this foundation of approximately one thousand improv elements to create a tool that generates a random workshop by picking 8 different exercises. This was the birth of the Impromat: an app to easily plan improvisational theatre workshops.

If Impromat helps you or if you have other comments, then drop me an email at [impromat@marcoklein.dev](mailto:impromat@marcoklein.dev).

Happy improvising
