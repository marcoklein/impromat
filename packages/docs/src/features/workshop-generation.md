# Workshop Generation

## Background & Context

The focus of Impromat is improvisational theatre workshops. Thus, the AI-assisted generation of workshops helps with showing what Impromat is capable of. It also helps with the creation of workshops for facilitators.

## Simple Generation

This section describes the very basic approach to generating a workshop:

Process:

1. Pick a random topic tag from a specified list of tags. (Example: "Character")

2. Search 2 - 4 elements for warmup.
3. Search 2 - 4 elements for exercises.
4. Search 2 - 4 elements for games.

5. Write a description for the workshop.
   - Based on names of elements (or on short description alternatively)
6. Write a name for the workshop.

Result:

Workshop with a random topic and a set of elements that fit the topic.
