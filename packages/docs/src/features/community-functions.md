# Community Functions

> How can we design a community where everyone can contribute while preventing a full chaos?

## Thought about requirements

- Prevent public elements that only a single user can edit.
- Prevent everyone from editing a single element.

## General thoughts

- Other applications

  - **Improwiki.com**: with an account you can freely edit the whole wiki.
  - **Fandom.com**: different levels of groups or reputation. E.g. a user may get a moderator to be able to edit elements. See https://community.fandom.com/de/wiki/Wiki-Adoptionen.
  - **Stackoverflow**: for good elements you get points and reputation and thus you get more "rights" to edit other people elements or publish more.
