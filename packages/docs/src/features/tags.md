# Context & Background

## Tags Sources

Currently, they are very unstructured and base mostly on already existing tags from the sources (e.g. improwiki, improvencyclopedia and improvresourcecenter). They provide _context_ for a certain element type.

Tags are used to cluster and categorize elements of a similar kind. Those clusters are varying and have to be defined by people that know improv and the planning of workshops.

> Tags add context to an element.

Now, there is this inherit challenge of clustering: how do you shape categories? When is an element in, when is it outside of a cluster? What are the exact meanings of tags?

On the one hand, if every user had the power to freely add, edit, and remove any tags you will get hundreds of different categories. Some of them might mean the same thing but differently described like `character exercise` and plain `character`. On the other hand, if we would provide a strict categories we will miss out on the collective knowledge of all users. Some tags should be included that we did not consider initially.

> Categories evolve from the user base but must follow a process and logic to avoid chaos.
