> Random thoughts. Using cookie authentication atm.

Session / cookie:

Advantages:

- increased security because Browser cannot access cookie

Disadvantage:

- no control on client side

As I give authentication responsibility to the client side they should also be responsible of managing the access token.

JWT:

Advantages:

- easy (?)
