        "markdown": "**Synonyms**\n\nDirected Story. Story Orchestra. Story Story.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nLet’s get four or five players in a line and create a story.\n\n**Description**\n\nThe line of players are tasked with telling a story together. The leader will pick one player to start the story. As long as they are being pointed at (conducted) the player will continue to tell the story. Without warning the leader will switch to another player and that player will seamlessly pick up the story.\n\nThe goal of the exercise is to have the players seamlessly continue to tell the story. If the conductor moves from one player to another mid sentence the player will pick up mid sentence. If the conductor moves from player to player mid word the player will pick up mid word. If it is working the exercise will sound like one person telling a story.\n\nFor example, player Eh could be mid-word, “many children were afraid of Carl for he was known to ha-” Player Bee, would pick up the story mid-word “-ve piles of library books that were overdue.” This should sound like “many children were afraid of Carl for he was known to ha-ve many piles of library books that were overdue.”\n\nThe leader can add complications to the structure by endowing the story with emotions, genres or occupations.\n\nStory Story is a structure that exercises the goals of LACE and STEPS.\n\n**Listening**\n\nThe exercise works best when all the players are listening. By listening to the words the player can have the next word or part of a word in their head ready to jump into their mouth. Not listening stands out acutely. A player who is not listening will radically change the story and mess up the narrative.\n\n**Accepting**\n\nThe players must accept the offers that have gone before. The existing narrative is the offer that the next player gets to work with. Changing the narrative radically could be a listening problem or an accepting problem. The players must exercise a state of perpetual acceptance of the offers coming from the player speaking.\n\nNo one player is in control of the story. Accepting that the story will change is accepting the narrative that has gone before. Trying to pressure a story “back on course” is a complicated denial.\n\n**Commitment**\n\nIn simplest terms the player must trust their instinct and go where their ideas take them without pause.\n\n**Expanding**\n\nDon’t explode the story. Small incremental steps of expansion or advancing works best. Offer suffocation is where too many offers spoil the narrative by making it impossible to follow. Look to what has gone before and add to it.\n\n**STEPS**\n\nThis is a narrative exercise. The conducted story needs a setting, and ties. It must have something to explore and propel.\n\n**Gimmicks**\n\n*   Leave the conduction on one player for a long time.\n*   Quickly move from player to player\n\n**Variations**\n\n*   Gibberish – Seamless gibberish is a real thing.\n*   Back Story – Conductor is behind the players touching their backs without warning.\n*   Word At A Time – each player contributes only one word at a time.\n*   Die Game – competitive version where players who slip or pause are ejected from the line.\n\n**Credits**\n\nNone",

        "markdown": "**Synonyms**\n\nName Game, Shriner Warm-up\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThis warm up will help us all get moving, listening and learning some names. Let’s form a large circle.\n\n**Description**\n\nHigh Fives is the same warm up as Cross Circle. The difference is that there are two player names (and hence two players) being called at the same time. As the players cross the circle they high five each other in the middle. After the high five the two players call on two more players and take their place in the circle.\n\nIn this warm up players will be crossing the circle to occupy another player’s spot across the circle. They signal who’s spot they are going to occupy by calling our the player’s name. After a player’s name has been called out that player call’s out another players name and moves toward their spot.\n\nIf the above explanation worked there will always be a player walking across the circle to a new spot. If the above explanation did not work try the painfully detailed one below.\n\n***\n\nAll the players are arranged in a large circle facing inwards. A player named Eh will randomly pick a player across the circle and call out their name. Let’s presume the player across the circle is named Bee. Player Eh will make eye contact, point towards and then call out “Bee.” Hopefully this will have gotten Bee’s attention.\n\nPlayer Eh will start to move across the circle towards Bee. Player’s do not run across the circle. Player Eh is going to occupy player Bee’s spot so player Bee has to get moving.\n\nNow player Bee will make eye contact with, point towards and call the name of another player in the circle. Surprisingly this new player’s name is Cee. Bee will start casually moving towards Cee in the circle. Player Eh will now occupy the empty space in the circle left by Bee as she has now started walking towards Cee.\n\n***\n\nThis can continue endlessly until fatigue or hunger sets in\n\nThis is a great warm up for learning names. Encourage players to say the names loud and clear so that others can learn names as well. However learning names barely scratches the surface of what this warm up offers. Every aspect of LACE, and more, is demonstrated in cross circle.\n\n**Listening.** Clearly players must be listening for their names. That is clear enough. There is a lot more to listen for in cross circle. Players can work in listening with their eyes for the initial eye contact. Players can work on listening to the whole stage by learning names of players as others cross the circle. Emotional and subtext listening can be picked up when a player is projecting the angst of not knowing the other player’s name.\n\n**Commitment.** There is tremendous social pressure to get things right, especially names. Getting players to publicly take risks regarding other players names helps build risk taking behaviour. There is not wrong. Your fellow players will support you. In improv you never know what is next. So stick to your choice loud and proud. If Nancy turns out to be Norma you will be forgiven and we all will learn as a group.\n\n\\*\\*Support. \\*\\*We feel our names are important to us. If someone messes our name up in cross circle we will be supportive. This trains being supportive at all times. Supportive players makes cross circle work better as well.\n\n\\*\\*Focus. \\*\\*Taking it. We deserve the attention of others. If we don’t get it with eye contact we point, and then we call out the player’s name. Focus is also about giving focus. Every player must throw focus to the player\n\n**Rules Not Goals.** Errors are not corrected they are supported. A successful cross circle is about intent and messing it up is funny. Eventually the group of players will self correct cross circle especially once\n\n**Variations**\n\n*   Cross Circle\n*   Subtle Crossings – remove pointing and player naming rely on just eye contact.\n*   Word at a Time – replace the player’s name with a word to create a word at a time story.\n\n**Credits**\n\nNone",

One player is in front, with two players behind her and three players behind them and so on. You are forming a pyramid.\n\n**Description**\n\nThis warm up is best done with music. The first player starts a repetitive movement or dance. The two players immediately behind the lead player mimic her movements as best as possible. Each row of players follows the row of players ahead of them. Flock Dance works best if the players only try and mimic the players in the line ahead of them. There should be both a delay and a decay in the lead player’s movements.\n\nFlock Dance is a physical warm up that also helps players by getting them to move in uncharacteristic ways. Often players will focus only on the lead player even if they are in the last line. It is important to encourage the players to only follow those directly in front of them. Players can use this as a practise for getting things wrong. Trying to do a perfect Flock Dance defeats the purpose of Flock Dance. Embrace failure, embrace chaos, and let go of being “right.”\n\n*   Lead player turns to face the flock, forcing them to turn around and free style\n*   Lead player moves so fast that not even the front line can keep up\n\n**Variations**\n\n*   Aerobics – there is no layering of the players and everyone copies lead\n*   Conga Line – there is a line instead of a flock and the lead player moves about the room\n\n**Credits**\n\nThanks to Richard.
